<h1>Greetings and Salutations</h1>
<p>Welcome to the blog by Midnight Overlord. This will serve as an archive of my thoughts during this tumultous time. I'm not sure if I will just add entries onto the index.html file, or just go with links to separate entries. Hopefully for those who know me irl you can recognize my voice through text, but don't doxx me, k thx.</p>
